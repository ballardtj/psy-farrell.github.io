        New ipad = lush paper reviews

    <p>One nice feature of the new iPad (iPad 3.0, whatever) is that it has voice dictation built in. This isn&rsquo;t Siri, but simply a mechanism for talking loudly and unnaturally to the iPad and getting back a text transcription of what you said. This makes reviewing a breeze. I tend to mark up PDF&rsquo;s on the iPad with comments, and the voice transcription gets around using the software keyboard which, though OK, isn&rsquo;t really ideal for typing more than a few words.</p>

        Switching between Scrivener and Bibdesk
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">02 Jun 2012</span>

    <p>For the past 8 years or so, I&rsquo;ve used
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a> almost exclusively to write
my (academic) papers. Once it is up and running it takes care of the
nitty gritty of formatting and referencing, meaning you can focus more
on the writing. For several of those 8 years I&rsquo;ve been on a mac, and
finding the combination of
<a href="http://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/">TeXShop</a> and
<a href="http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/">BibDesk</a> pretty darn awesome. BibDesk
is a reference manager for the Mac that stores its database in BibTeX
format (a standard bibliographical format used by LaTeX). TeXShop is an
editing program built for editing LaTeX files; these are plain text and
could be edited in any old text editor, but TeXShop provides nice LaTeX
syntax highlighting and a fairly useful macro system (and is less busy
than other editors I&rsquo;ve looked at).</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>Having said that, TeXShop is pretty ugly to work in sometimes when there
are lots of comments and insertions around and things start to get
messy. So recently I&rsquo;ve been using
<a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a> to write my
papers and similar documents. Scrivener is basically a lovely looking
writing environment that let&rsquo;s you make comments separate from the doc
(a la Word), and has some nifty features for managing project-related
files and snippets (great for collecting random thoughts you want to put
in a paper <em>somewhere</em> at a later date&hellip;but not just now!). It doesn&rsquo;t
do LaTeX natively, but I&rsquo;ve got a pretty smooth system converting to
LaTeX via
<a href="http://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/">multimarkdown</a> (more on that
another time). One thing I miss about TeXShop is the ability to quickly
search for BibDesk references inside the editor. We can&rsquo;t do this (at
least while it isn&rsquo;t scriptable), but the next best thing is to set up
some shortcuts to switch between the apps. My setup is as follows:</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>* In Scrivener, I have BibDesk set as my bibliography manager (under
Preferences &gt; General). This does little more than switch to BibDesk
when I press command-Y.</p>

<p>\</p>

<p>* I have a little applescript in BibDesk that it is triggered by the
same command-Y key combination. It will take the references currently
highlighted in BibDesk and copy them to Scrivener. The applescript is as
follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>tell</strong> <em>application</em> &ldquo;System Events&rdquo; <strong>to</strong> <strong>keystroke</strong> &ldquo;c&rdquo; using
{command down}\
<strong>tell</strong> <em>application</em> &ldquo;Scrivener&rdquo;\
<strong>activate</strong><strong>tell</strong> <em>application</em> &ldquo;System Events&rdquo; <strong>to</strong>
<strong>keystroke</strong> &ldquo;v&rdquo; using {command down}\
<strong>end</strong> <strong>tell</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>* All this will do is copy whatever BibDesk usually copies into
Scrivener. We want to copy the references over in multimarkdown&rsquo;s
referencing format, and can do this using templates in BibDesk; see
 <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/multimarkdown/browse_thread/thread/0c9937c17906a8b1/6f633137107832fa?#6f633137107832fa">here</a>
for a discussion and examples. Mine looks like this:\</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[#&lt;\$publications.citeKey.@componentsJoinedByComma/&gt;][]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So when I press command-Y in BibDesk (having selected a few references)
I get something like [#Estes55;][] back in the Scrivener doc. It&rsquo;s a
bit slow and clunky but does the job. Also, I&rsquo;m not really an
Applescript programmer, so there may be a more sensible way to do this.\

        Major minor annoyances
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">18 May 2012</span>

    <p>Some people have issues with the fancy new appearance of the Google
products that&rsquo;s been rolled out over past 6 months or so. I don&rsquo;t
actually, but in the process it seems Google have also been shaping the
profile of their products and services.\
 \
 One manifestation of this is in the drop-down box under &ldquo;More&rdquo; when you
run a search. One option under that menu I used to use extensively was
Google Scholar, which would take the search term you just used and use
it to search Google Scholar. Now, you click on &ldquo;More&rdquo;, go down to the
bottom of the long list of options to select &ldquo;Even More&rdquo;, and then get
taken to a web page which has Google Scholar there somewhere, just keep
looking. Click on Scholar, and oh, by the way, you&rsquo;ve lost your original
search term.\
 \
 This might be a symptom of the larger number of services that Google
offers, but seems crazy for two reasons:\
 \
 a) Some of the options in the menu bar or the &ldquo;more&rdquo; menu itself show
up in the side bar after you&rsquo;ve run a search anyway; redundant! Why not
put Google Scholar over on the left there buddy?\
 b) It&rsquo;s not clear why there isn&rsquo;t space for Scholar, but there is for
options like &ldquo;Finance&rdquo; and &ldquo;Books&rdquo;.\
 \
 I find it hard to believe, but maybe this shows that academic users are
in the minority.
<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2012/03/bring_back_goog.php">Some</a>
have implied that this is all about commercialisation, and
<a href="http://www.searchengineshowdown.com/blog/2012/02/google_bar_goes_back_to_top_.shtml">others</a>
wondering whether this is the end for Scholar altogether (I doubt it,
given Google seems to have some <a href="http://research.google.com/">interest in research and academic
collaboration</a>).\
 \
 Anyway, a solution is to forego Google altogether. I&rsquo;ve been
using <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> as a search engine, and it&rsquo;s
pretty neat. The results it returns are nice and clean, it&rsquo;s <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/privacy.html">attitude
to privacy</a> is refreshing (it
allows users some), and most importantly it allows specifying particular
web sites to search using a bang (!) character. So Google Scholar is
!gsc and can be entered on the fly, and once used is easily accessible
in a drop down box for future searches.\
 \
 Long-term, the question is what happens with offerings like Google
Scholar, and whether alternatives like <a href="http://academic.research.microsoft.com/">Microsoft Academic
Search</a> become more appealing.</p>

    <span class="post-date">06 Mar 2012</span>

    <p>Just found a neat tool for OS X called
<a href="http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/">GeekTool</a>. It installs an item
in the preferences pane that allows you to show all kinds of geeky stuff
(CPU load, memory usage etc.) on your desktop. People have done some
pretty cool things with it, but my use is more mundane: just checking
that all my <a href="https://bitbucket.org/obensonne/hg-autosync/wiki/Home">hg

      <a href="/2012/02/03/mercurial/">
        Mercurial, Dropbox for geeks
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">03 Feb 2012</span>

    <p>I&rsquo;ll admit it, <a href="http://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a> is pretty cool. It&rsquo;s
great for quickly sharing photos and docs with others (including
collaborators), and for a while I was using it to keep much of my
working directory in sync across computers. What&rsquo;s especially cool is
the rat pack add-on, which keeps track of all your file changes so you
can revert to an old version if you do something stupid (and boy, can I
do some stupid things).\
 \
 However, last year there were a few privacy issues raised with Dropbox.
The first is that there is no client-side encryption. That means that
although your data is encrypted on their servers, this can be decrypted
by them also. Their policy is not to do that, but they *can* be forced
to &ldquo;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/dmca#security">when legally required to do
so</a>&rdquo;. Then there are fond
memories of the time that <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2011/06/20/dropbox-accounts-lef.html">every single account was left accessible
without a
password</a>
for a good few hours. Ouch!\
 \
 Even though the work I&rsquo;ve been sharing on Dropbox isn&rsquo;t super-sensitive
(just working papers, data analyses and modelling), this isn&rsquo;t really
reassuring. One solution is to use services like
<a href="http://getsecretsync.com/">SecretSync</a>. However, this requires forking
over money for a pretty basic service that Dropbox should be providing
by default. So instead I&rsquo;ve turned to a geeky option called
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a>. I&rsquo;ve actually been using
this for a few years to keep stuff in sync with <a href="http://www.cogsciwa.com/">Steve
Lewandowsky</a> when we were writing our
<a href="http://www.sagepub.com/books/Book233316">masterpiece</a>, and it works
really well.\
 \
 Mercurial is technically known as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_revision_control">distributed version control
system</a>. We
start off with a seed repository, which contains the initial state of
all our files (if any), and initialize it. Then every user of the
repository can clone that repository to their own computer so they have
local copies of the files. One important thing is that the files in our
directory are kept separate from the repository itself. Accordingly,
working practice is to edit as per usual, and then every now and then to
&ldquo;commit&rdquo; those changes to the repository (e.g., at the end of the day,
or when you&rsquo;ve reached a milestone). However, even after committing
those changes, they&rsquo;ll still just be local to your computer.
Accordingly, one needs to push their changes to the central repository
(which is usually hosted on a server, and talked to via ssh or the like)
and pull changes that other users might have made.\
 \
 One nice thing is the merge feature. If I&rsquo;ve made changes to a file,
and you&rsquo;ve made changes to the same file in the interim, then mercurial
can automatically merge those changes in an intelligent fashion. In
cases where changes can&rsquo;t be merged (i.e., we modified the same line in
the file), we can use a program like
<a href="http://kdiff3.sourgeforge.net/">kdiff3</a> to manually resolve the
conflicts; in my experience this happens pretty rarely. Another cool
thing is that we also have a record of all changes we&rsquo;ve made to all
files in the repository since the intialization. This has been a
lifesaver in cases where, for example, some model simulations have been
working really well, but then in overexuberant exploration I&rsquo;ve made
some silly edits and lost the working version of the model (yes, I can
be that silly sometimes).\
 \
 By default, committing, pulling and pushing all need to be carried out
manually. However, I&rsquo;ve been using an extension called
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/AutoSyncExtension">autosync</a> that
will automatically go through a commit/pull/merge/push cycle regularly.
Mine fires off every 10 minutes, so my computers are more or less in
constant sync. This avoids one problem with Dropbox, which is that it
eagerly syncs across all the crappy auxiliary files that are generated
when compiling LaTeX documents. I&rsquo;ve got my Mac set up to delete all the
auxiliary files after completion, so this mostly prevents this
happening. Deleting those auxiliary files does mean each compilation
takes longer, but hey, compiling is just really fast these days.\
 \
 So Dropbox, you&rsquo;ve a great service, but I think we should just keep it
casual.</p>
