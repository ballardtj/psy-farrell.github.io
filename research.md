My main research emphasis is on the application of computational models to human cognition. Accordingly, my work uses these models to competitively and quantitatively test different theories; to show how theoretical mechanisms can sometimes do surprising things; and to point to integrating principles across different areas. This has culminated in the publication of a textbook on computational modelling (on the publications page; see also Farrell & Lewandowsky, 2010).
