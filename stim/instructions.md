# Instructions

In this experiment you will be presented with lists of words, and will be asked to carry out one of several tasks after the words have been presented.

On each trial, a sequence of 12 words will be presented sequentially on the screen. The words will be presented in groups of four, each group being separated by a pause.

After presentation of the final word in the sequence, an answer box will appear, in which you can type. Above the box there will be a cue telling you what you are to do:

## A single digit: ##

In the box, type in the words presented in that group in any order. For example, if *'2'* appeared above the box, you would type in the words presented in the second group.

## More than one digit: ##

If two digits appear (e.g., *'1 and 2'*),  your task is to make a new group out of the two groups in the cue. For example, if '1 or 2' appears, you need to make a new group comprised of words presented in either of those groups. If the cue *'Any'* appears, your new group can be composed of words from groups 1, 2, or 3 (i.e., any word in the list).

If you are cued to make a new group, please make sure that you do make a new group, and don't just reproduce any of the original groups. Your new group should contain four words, the same number of words as in the original groups.

## Typing in your answer ##

When the cue and answer box appear, type your words one by one into the answer box. After each word, press the enter key to record that word and move on to entering the next word. Once you've entered four words, or time runs out (you'll have 15 seconds to type in your answer), you will be asked to press the space bar to move on to the next trial. When that message appears, feel free to take a break before pressing the space bar and moving on. Don't worry if you can't think of four words: just enter as many words as you can think of, and wait until the 15 seconds is up and the experiment moves on.

## Any questions ##

There won't be any practice, so please read through the instructions again to make sure you understand them. If you're still not sure, please direct any questions to the experimenter. Once you're ready to proceed, call the experimenter over so the experiment can begin.
