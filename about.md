I am a Professor in the [School of Experimental Psychology](http://www.psychology.uwa.edu.au) at the [University of Bristol](http://www.uwa.edu.au). My research involves experiments on human beings guided by computational models. Research areas include working memory and episodic memory (particularly for order and time) and modelling of decision making.

My past and present collaborators include [Steve Lewandowsky](http://www.cogsciwa.com), [Klaus Oberauer](http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/fachrichtungen/allgpsy/Team/Oberauer_en.html), Chris Jarrold, [Casimir Ludwig](http://casimir.psy.bris.ac.uk/), Iain Gilchrist, [Eric-Jan Wagenmakers](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/) and [Roger Ratcliff](http://star.psy.ohio-state.edu/coglab/). I (co)supervise some great PhD students including [Alice Mason](http://www.bris.ac.uk/expsych/people/alice-mason/overview.html), [Rebecca Floyd](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/expsych/people/rebecca-a-floyd/index.html), [Adnane Ez-Zizi](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/expsych/people/adnane-ez-zizi/index.html) and Robert Udale (Bristol).

I am an Associate Editor for the [Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology](http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/pp/02724995.html).

In my current research position I don't do much teaching. In previous ears I have taught about experimental methods (1st year), the psychology of science (3rd year), memory (2nd year), statistics (MSc), cognitive modelling (3rd year), neuropsychology (MSc), and psychology of language (MSc).
