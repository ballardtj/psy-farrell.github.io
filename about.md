I am an ARC Future Fellow in the [School of  Psychology](http://www.psychology.uwa.edu.au) at the [University of Western Australia](http://www.uwa.edu.au). My research involves experiments on human beings guided by computational models. Research areas include working memory and episodic memory (particularly for order and time) and modelling of decision making.

My past and present collaborators include Chris Jarrold, [Casimir Ludwig](http://casimir.psy.bris.ac.uk/), [Satoru Saito](http://www.educ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/cogpsy/member/saitos_e.htm), [Mark Hurlstone](http://mark-hurlstone.github.io), [Steve Lewandowsky](http://www.cogsciwa.com), [Klaus Oberauer](http://www.psychologie.uzh.ch/fachrichtungen/allgpsy/Team/Oberauer_en.html), Iain Gilchrist, [Eric-Jan Wagenmakers](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/) and [Roger Ratcliff](http://star.psy.ohio-state.edu/coglab/). I (co)supervise some great PhD students including [Alice Mason](http://www.bris.ac.uk/expsych/people/alice-mason/overview.html), [Rebecca Floyd](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/expsych/people/rebecca-a-floyd/index.html), [Adnane Ez-Zizi](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/expsych/people/adnane-ez-zizi/index.html) and Robert Udale (all at Bristol).

I am an Associate Editor for the [Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology](http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/pp/02724995.html).

I teach a research+seminar unit that in previous years has covered reward and memory, and the psychology of science. In previous years I have taught about experimental methods (1st year), the psychology of science (3rd year), memory (2nd year), statistics (MSc), cognitive modelling (3rd year), neuropsychology (MSc), and the psychology of language (MSc).
